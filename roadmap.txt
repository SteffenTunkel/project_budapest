Step1: READ THE DATA

read the data into arrays and fix the broken frames DONE
create the database and write the laser_scanner_data in one 'main' table DONE
create a 'time' table with one timestamp for each frame DONE

Step2: FIND THE BACKGROUND

create a 'background' table, with the laser_id and azimuth as primary key duo, one more value (median) needed
select all coordinates with common laser_id and azimuth and find the median
save the median coordinate set in the 'background' table
create a 'moving' table. The definition is the same as 'main' plus the parameter 'object_no', which is all zero at this point
compare each record in the 'background' table with all the fitting records in 'main'
If the 'distance' of the the data from 'main' is NOT within a certain tolerance around the median, safe the record in 'moving'

Step3: FIND CLUSTERS

Get all the records for one frame from 'moving' and safe them in an array
Give the first record the 'object_no' '1'.
Compare it with all the other records (x,y,z dimensional) and also give that number to all the records within a certain tolerance
Start over with the next record and give it the 'object_no' '2', if it's still a '0'
Compare it with all the remaining records (x,y,z) and check if they are within a certain tolerance
  If so, check if the other record already has a number, if so change all the records with one of the two numbers to the lower on
...
All the steps again for each frame

Step4: CALCULATE THE FOCUS

Step5: CALCULATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE FOCUSES

Step6: VISULIZE RESULTS
